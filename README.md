## Overview of Election Audit
	
The purpose of this project is to perform an analysis of election results among three Colorado counties. In order to perform this analysis, we were given a .csv file of all submitted votes with voter IDs, the County the vote was submitted in, and which candidate was selected by each voter. From this resource, we were able to leverage Python to automate creation of a summary document with relevant statitstics about the election. With this tool, we are able to identify with confidence the winner of the election.

## Summary

This Python script has considerable utility beyond the scope of this project. Any .csv file formatted in the same way as the original can be analyzed by running this program with some further modifications. The program already retains the capability to dynamically read files with any number of candidates and counties. This would greatly reduce the workload of and the costs to the Election Commission in future elections. This code can also be modified - upon the contracting of our firm for futher work - to give a breakdown of candidate votes by county, as well as email the final analysis document to any relevant parties immediately upon completion. For further information please contact.
